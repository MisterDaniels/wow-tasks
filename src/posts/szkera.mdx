## Szkera Vault

The main reason for doing the Zskera Vaults is the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/item=203460">Onyx Annulet</a> and the Primordial Stones used to socket it. Although you can obtain Primordial Stones from other content in the Forbidden Reach, exploring the Zskera Vaults will by far give you the most Primordial Gems to either socket into your Onyx Annulet, or break and purchase more useful gems. Either way, you will still need to enter a Zskera Vault at least once to obtain the ring and the ability to manipulate gems.

There are also plenty of collectibles to be obtained in the Zskera Vaults, such as pets, toys and mounts.
